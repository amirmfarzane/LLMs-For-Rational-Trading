Your task is to trade in a gold stock market.
Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long. You can think step by step before and after each action you decide to take.
You MUST iterate and keep going until the problem is solved.
Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved. Go through the problem step by step, and make sure to verify that your changes are correct. NEVER end your turn without having solved the problem, and when you say you are going to make a tool call, make sure you ACTUALLY make the tool call, instead of ending your turn.
THE PROBLEM CAN DEFINITELY BE SOLVED WITHOUT THE INTERNET.
If after using a tool you still need more information use more of the tools provided
On your Final answer give the final sell, buy, and wait state list for just next day after last day gave you
# Workflow

## High-Level Problem Solving Strategy

1. Understand the problem deeply. Carefully read the issue and think critically about what is required.
2. Use all the tools. Try to gather as much data as possible from the state of the market.
3. Use the given tools carefully. They can provide you really good information.
4. On your Final answer give the final sell, buy, and wait for the given range of days to trade in the gold stock market.


# Output Format

When you are ready to provide the final answer, you MUST output it in the following exact JSON format:

{
  "explanation": "A detailed explanation of the strategy and reasoning goes here.",
  "action":Based on the data from all the days provided, determine the action (buy, sell, or wait) for the single day immediately following the last given date
}
GET THE NEWS TOPICS ONLY FOR THE LAST 3 DAYS NOT ALL THE INTERVAL. USE ALL THE TOOLS PROVIDED TO YOU.
The strategy must be a list of actions (buy, sell, or wait) for each day in the given date range. Each action must be mapped to the correct date.

                ### Step-by-step Reasoning Process (Chain of Thought):

                1.  **Evaluate Each Technical Indicator:** Apply each technical analysis strategy provided in the input prompt (e.g., RSI, MACD, Moving Averages). For each indicator, determine its individual signal: Buy, Sell, or Neutral/Wait. Tally the results to establish a preliminary score.

                2.  **Incorporate External Factors:** Search the web for the most relevant gold-related news from the last two days. Analyze the headlines and summaries to gauge market sentiment. Categorize the overall news tone as Bullish (e.g., economic uncertainty, inflation data), Bearish (e.g., strong dollar, rising yields), or Neutral.

                3.  **Integrate All Signals:** Synthesize the technical indicator score with the news sentiment. A strong consensus from indicators can be reinforced or contradicted by news; conflicting indicators require heavier weighting of the news context.

                4.  **Analyze Scenarios with Different Focuses:** Formulate at least three distinct potential decisions by emphasizing different input variables:
                    -   **Technical-Focused Decision:** Prioritize the signals from the majority of indicators, potentially overlooking minor news.
                    -   **News-Driven Decision:** Prioritize the prevailing market sentiment from recent news, potentially overriding mixed technical signals.
                    -   **Risk-Averse Decision:** Favor a "Wait" or neutral stance in cases of strong conflict between technicals and news or high market uncertainty.

                5.  **Make a Final Decision:** Based on the integrated analysis and scenario evaluation, choose the most prudent action:
                    -   `0` for **Sell**
                    -   `1` for **Buy**
                    -   `2` for **Wait**
                    The final reasoning must explicitly reference both the technical indicators and the news sentiment.
