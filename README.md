# 📈 Language Models for Rational, Evidence-Driven Trading

This project explores the use of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **machine learning** to build an intelligent, explainable trading agent. By combining **textual signals** (from social media, financial news, and political speeches) with **numerical market indicators**, we aim to forecast XUA-USD trends with actionable insights and human-readable justifications.
